Project Overview

This project uses Large Language Models (LLM) to automate the process of containerization and deployment. The main objectives are:

1. Streamline Containerization: Automatically generate Dockerfiles based on user input, minimizing the complexity and time spent manually writing Dockerfiles.
2. Simplify Deployment: Provide a one-click solution for building and running containers on servers, making deployment easier.
3. Enhance Accessibility: Offer a user-friendly web interface that allows developers of all experience levels to containerize and deploy applications with ease.
4. Improve Consistency: Ensure uniform container configurations by generating AI-powered Dockerfiles, reducing the potential for human errors.
5. Accelerate DevOps Practices: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines to automate the entire process, from code commit to deployment, speeding up the software delivery lifecycle.

By automating these processes, the project aims to significantly reduce the time and effort required for containerization and deployment, bridging the gap between development and operations for faster, more reliable software delivery. The system combines AI with cloud infrastructure and DevOps workflows, making container-based application deployment more accessible and efficient for developers.
